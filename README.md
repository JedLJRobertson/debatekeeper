Debatekeeper &mdash; a timer for debate speeches
================================================

Debatekeeper is an Android app that times speeches in debates and rings bells
automatically at the correct times.  It supports most parliamentary styles
of debating, including British Parliamentary, Australasian, Asian, Australian,
American Parliamentary, certain forms of Canadian Parliamentary and
all New Zealand styles.

The app rings a bell, vibrates and/or flashes the screen white (or any
combination of the three) at bell times.  It also rings overtime bells,
which are configurable.

Adding debate styles
--------------------
I've included all the parliamentary debate styles I can find, but I
obviously don't know about all the different styles in the world.  If
there's a style you'd like me to add, please do any of the following,
in order of preference:

1. Fork this repository, add your debate format XML file to the assets
directory, and submit a pull request.  This is preferred because it's
easiest for me and means your contribution is recorded in the
repository commits.

2. Send me your debate format XML file (contact details below), and
I'll add it to the repository.

3. Describe the debate style to me (speech times, bell times, names
of positions, _etc._) at the contact details below and I'll write
the XML file and add it to the repository.

This app doesn't (yet) do the public policy, Lincoln-Douglas or policy
debate styles.  There are other Android apps that do this.  This app 
doesn't currently have support for preparation time that can be used
by teams between speeches at their election; I may or may not add this
in future.
