	<!--******************************** NOTE ON PERIODS *********************************
	  In the proposed schema overhaul, there will be four standard period types defined:
	  "normal", "pois-allowed", "warning" and "overtime". XML file authors will not need
	  to define these themselves any more. The idea is to make consistency between these
	  standard period types easier.  It also allows for the future possibility of
	  allowing the user to define background colours as a preference.

	  Because some styles would have special period types, we introduce a new
	  <period-types> element.  Only non-standard period types need to be defined here.
	  The catch is that these period types will be considered global, so they must have
	  unique names among ALL debate formats, unless they are being deliberately shared.
	  This allows for them to be included in the user-defined background colours, and
	  also allows for de facto new "standard" period types to emerge, if necessary.
	  An example of this is the "choose moot" and "choose side" periods of Easters prep
	  time.
